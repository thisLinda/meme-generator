## About the Project
This is the Scrimba Learn React Instruction Project 3. Target learning: state and effect hooks (as well as event listening, conditional rendering, forms). 

I had the gift of time to do the work for this project and took advantage of it. I listened to instruction, listened again and coded along, tried it on my own referring back countless times until I got it correct. And then I broke it and tried different approaches.

## What I'd Like to Do Next
Next step will be to learn [CSS modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/) and apply to this project.
